# Navi48-MacOS - changes since the previous public snapshot (5 October 2026)

Kext: Navi48Bringup 0.0.664. Metal bundle: revision 20.
Mesa patches: nine (was five), still on the same pinned Mesa commit. Everything below is
experimental, has been exercised on one test PC with one RX 9070 XT, and several parts sit
behind boot-args that are OFF by default.

## Multi-display (milestone "M6")

- **Stage 1a** (kext 0.0.659, boot-arg `navi48-m6=1`)
  The second display's pipe is adopted on Apple's presentation path beside the first:
  every pipe is adopted, and the surface-ID table is learned in the submit hook.
- **Stage 1b** (0.0.661, `navi48-m6=1` and `navi48-m6flip=1`)
  The second display gets its own scanout (instance 2): user-client ABI 1.11, selectors
  22..26 (acquire / register / present / status / release), poll-only. Mesa patch 0009
  adds the matching radv_darwin_n48n_call / bo_handle entry points.
- **Stage 2** (0.0.662, additionally `navi48-m6flip1=1`)
  A third display (instance 1): per-instance descriptors (HUBP1/OTG1), scanout state,
  locks, pins and watchdog, a teardown-all path, and clash checks against the other
  instances. ABI 1.12 (selectors 22..26 also accept instance 1; an extra output word).
- **Review fixes:** a self-healing surface table (staleness, re-learn, eviction), a serialised
  table publish, the blob sizing hot fix in 0.0.661, and DP-plane geometry checks in the
  Metal bundle. Run kits: `tools/pc/m6-stage1a-*`, `m6-stage1b-*`, `m6-stage2-run.sh` and a
  simulation harness (`tools/pc/m6-stage2-sim`) that checks the scripts' parsers and
  scenarios without hardware.

## Resizable BAR (0.0.663, 0.0.664)

The kext can map a BAR0 larger than 256 MiB (up to 1 GiB). The decision is a pure,
unit-tested function (`src/navi48-bringup/src/amd/rebar_pure.h`, `plan_bar0`) that refuses a
zero or non-power-of-two length, a misaligned base, a disagreement between IOPCIFamily and
config space, a ReBAR size mismatch and over-large maps. 0.0.664 adds review fixes: the
doorbell self-ring is not enabled after a BASE_LOW/HIGH read-back mismatch, and BAR2 is
refused when IOPCIFamily and config space disagree.

## In-process shader translation (Metal bundle 14)

Processes other than WindowServer (sandboxed applications) can translate Metal AIR to
SPIR-V inside the process: Apple's own compiler library prints the AIR as LLVM text, and a
small C-ABI library (libn48xlate) translates it, replacing the helper daemon. The library
is the LGPL-3.0 n48xlate crate, a wrapper around metal2vulkan; it is NOT part of the MIT
code and lives, with our changes to metal2vulkan, in `third-party/metal2vulkan-n48/`
(see its NOTICE). `tools/native/navi48metal/n48_xlate.h` is the loader.

## Application fixes (Metal bundles 15..20)

- WindowServer import-memory exhaustion: a live-import ledger, a refused import never
  returns nil, an import cache on by default.
- Occlusion queries (setVisibilityResultMode) over a per-command-buffer Vulkan query pool;
  resolve before the command buffer completion handler.
- RG16Uint pixel format mapped to VK_FORMAT_R16G16_UINT (menus whose shadow pass needs it).
- Visible-function linking for translated shaders (ABI 2 of libn48xlate).
- HDMI scanout "rubber band" fix: routed non-tentative writes are scanout writes while the
  routing latch is on; per-slot supersede marks replace an 8-entry surface table.
- GPU-application allow-list (kext: Navi48AppKey.h, appallow), default-deny.

## Auto-arm (`tools/pc/autoarm`)

A LaunchDaemon (once per boot) plus a fail-safe script that brings up the multi-display
GPU desktop unattended at the login window. The first failing step stops it and leaves the
CPU-rendered desktop; it stops if a user logs in; WindowServer is restarted exactly once.
The expected display CRC is measured on the boot itself (or set with `AA_CRC_RG2` /
`AA_CRC_B2`) rather than compiled in. Kill switch: a file named `autoarm-off`. `install.sh` and
`uninstall.sh` are provided; `run-tests.sh` runs the script against fake tools on a host Mac.

## Other

- New pure-function headers with host-run test suites and "planted break" scripts
  (`src/navi48-bringup/tests/native_*_plant.sh`).
- kext Makefile / BUILDING.md / firmware handling unchanged from the previous snapshot:
  the build still needs MacKernelSDK from RDNA4FB and the AMD firmware from linux-firmware.
- Not included, as before: AMD firmware, captures and fixtures derived from Apple software,
  translated Apple shaders (spvcache), build outputs, notes.
