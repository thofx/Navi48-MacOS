// n48_gate.h - the pure half of the bundle's load policy outside WindowServer (GPU-apps stage G4, kext 0.0.640; an internal design note section 2 and the G2 review).
// No Metal, no IOKit, no I/O: host test test-gate.c compiles this very header and drives the very functions Navi48Device.m calls (n48_admit, n48_pc_open, n48_fallback_ok).
//
// Three kinds of process load the bundle (every Metal-enumerating process does):
//   WS    WindowServer (getprogname() == "WindowServer"). Today's rules, bit for bit: the safety gates only decline on a POSITIVE reading.
//   ROOT  a root tool with N48M_ALLOW=1 (mtlprobe and friends). The same gates, but they now FAIL CLOSED (below).
//   OTHER any other process (an ordinary user application). Admitted only if the KERNEL admits it: the bundle opens (and at once closes) a probe connection to Navi48Bringup and
//         reads QueryInfo; the kernel's open policy (uid >= 501 + navi48-apps=1 + navi48-multisession=1 + the allow-list) is the only decision, never the process name. The kernel must
//         also report the APP role (ABI 1.10 budget flags): a root process the kernel admits as root stays declined unless it set N48M_ALLOW=1, as before. 0.0.641: and a process with
//         euid < 501 (root, daemons) is not probed at all (n48g_declined_by_class).
//
// FAIL CLOSED outside WindowServer. The G2 review found the three safety gates fail OPEN in a sandbox: stat("/private/tmp/n48m-off") is denied (EPERM, not ENOENT) and was read as
// "no kill file"; the nub properties Navi48,Ready / Navi48,AutoDisarmed are filtered by the sandbox's iokit-get-properties allow-list, so a denied read came back as "absent" and was
// read as "proceed". Outside WindowServer an answer that is not a positive "all clear" now declines:
//   * kill file: only ENOENT / ENOTDIR (a real "no such file") means absent; any other stat failure is UNREADABLE and declines.
//   * Navi48,Ready must be PRESENT and 1 (the kext publishes it on every nub since 0.0.612). Absent / unreadable / 0 declines.
//   * Navi48,AutoDisarmed: 1 declines. (The kext does not publish this property today, so an absent or denied read cannot be told apart from "not published": it cannot fail closed.
//     The display-pipe state is WindowServer's concern; an APP session never reaches the scanout selectors. Recorded as an open doubt.)
//   * the probe's QueryInfo: unreadable, N48N_INFO_HUNG set, or the APP role not reported, declines.
